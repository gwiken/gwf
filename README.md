Code Formating as I want it.
I use a quite odd code formatting, or so I hear.
So I will try to make an addon to VS, that "corrects" the formatting to MY liking.
Anyone who likes it is welcome to use it, and further down the line I will let other developers change the code.
But only if they let my formatting remain, and in an easy way to use.
That's about it.
